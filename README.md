There is a LinkedIn group where this library is discussed:

At the moment the functions are not very well documented. Generating
some useful functions has a higher priority. Most functions are easy to
understand, but when there is a function that would benefit greatly from
better documentation: let me know.

If you would like to see a certain function: let me know.
